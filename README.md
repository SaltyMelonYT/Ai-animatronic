This is a work-in-progress project to give AI the ability to see, and control itself. As of now I myself do not have the hardware to test such things.
This is an inspired project by [VomitedThoughts](https://www.youtube.com/@vomitedthoughts) and his Mimic and other FNaF related projects.
As of now the AI can **somewhat** see and understand its surroundings.
# Needed
* Servo control
* STT and TTS
* Communication between vision and communication (llava --> Llama)
* Less AI generated code as this is far to advanced for me
* Personality
* Memory (If the AI server is shutdown, it can look back at its memories for context) As well as the ability to write memories on its own
